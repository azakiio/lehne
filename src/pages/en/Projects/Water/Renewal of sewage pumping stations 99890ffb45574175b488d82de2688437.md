# Renewal of sewage pumping stations

The Hamburg Hochbahn AG operates pumping stations for waste water in 
the underground stations, which are mainly used for platform, track and 
escalator drainage. Furthermore, sanitary facilities from rentals and 
operating rooms are often connected to the pumping stations. LEHNE ing. 
has continuously renewed a large number of the pumping stations since 
2007. A few are selected here as examples.

The pumping stations usually have to be renewed in cramped spatial 
conditions and difficult accessibility. This often requires special 
technical solutions.

In these projects, in addition to operational safety, the 
construction process and project coordination are of great importance in
 order to keep restrictions on ongoing subway operations and other uses 
as low as possible.
