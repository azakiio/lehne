# Passage Rahlau

In connection with the lane extension of an inner-city main road in 
the east of Hamburg, an existing water crossing had to be expanded. The 
existing cullet structure had to be extended linearly by several meters.
 For this purpose, the deep-founded concrete retaining wall was 
partially demolished and a new angular retaining wall was erected.

The
 engineering services also included the tendering of the building as 
well as the selective support of technical details during the 
construction phase. The drainage of the construction site was achieved 
by the insertion of sheet piling walls on both sides. The pre-flood was 
maintained by a temporary elevated steel pipe.
