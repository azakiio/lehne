# Drainage Curslacker Neuer Deich

The surface drainage of roads and properties was planned for an 
industrial development of around 10 ha on a development area in the East
 of Hamburg. A special situation was formed in this case by the presence
 of a cleaned-up contaminated site in addition to part of an old 
flushing field, high groundwater levels, the location of the development
 area in a water conservation area with the relevant water conservation 
requirements in addition to outflow of the surface water into a waterway
 in a marshy area with low water movement.

Outflow of the surface water took place using ditches which were 
sealed off to the subsoil using minerals. Before introduction into the 
waterway, the water is cleaned and stabilised in a naturally-formed 
rainwater treatment system. The waterway is inside the dyke line so that
 the requirements of flood protection also have to be considered. 
Engineering services included planning, invitation to tender and 
preparation and procurement of the necessary water law and floodwater 
protection approvals.
