# Retaining wall Bergedorfer Schlossgraben

The Bergedorfer Schloßstraße is located in the area of Bergedorf, 
which is separated from the Bergedorfer Schloßgraben by an old retaining
wall consisting of erratic boulders and dry stonewalling which is 
subject to a preservation order. It is 30 m long and secures a change in
level of 1.5 m in height. During the construction measures, sheet 
piling and concrete work in addition to masonry and road construction 
work were carried out on the damaged retaining wall. Furthermore, the 
partially undermined retaining wall is characterised by deformation 
caused by increased traffic loading.

The retaining wall is subject to a city of Hamburg preservation 
order, which means that reconstruction of the damaged retaining wall had
to be recorded in detail using surveying operations so that the wall 
could be reconstructed using the existing material after the steel sheet piling wall had been constructed.

On top of this a sheet piling wall was constructed on the water side 
to create provisional working space. Water law permits had to be 
observed during the construction sequence.

Services included the controlled dismantling of the historic masonry 
wall, construction of the land-side steel sheet piling walls in addition
to work on the masonry for restoring the historic retaining wall before
securing the differences in surface height. The subsequent road 
construction work provided connection to the existing buildings once again.
