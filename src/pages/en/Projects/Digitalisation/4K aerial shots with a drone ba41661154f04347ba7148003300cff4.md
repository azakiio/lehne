# 4K aerial shots with a drone

Aerial images from drones are often used for professional media content. Whether for the image and video content of a website or for short advertising films, a view from above is appealing and provides an overview.

We use our own 4K drone to create content for our in-house channels and for external commissions.

We are also happy to advise and support you in the selection of motifs!
