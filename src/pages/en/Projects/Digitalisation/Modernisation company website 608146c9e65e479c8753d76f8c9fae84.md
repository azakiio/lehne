# Modernisation company website

The aim of this project was to modernize the web presence of a Hamburg-based company.

At the beginning, various layouts were designed and presented to the 
client. A suitable content management system was selected based on the 
user and support requirements and set up on the existing web server.

Suitable media files such as videos, images and texts were developed 
and implemented in the design. Our companies also used their own drone 
for aerial photography. After consultation with the client, the design 
of the page was finalized and the performance and functionality tested 
on various platforms.

Thus, within a few weeks from conception to launch, a modern and 
easy-to-maintain website could be created, which has satisfied our 
client very much.
