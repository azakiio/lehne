# Migration On-Premise zu Microsoft 365

After several failures of the local server, a medium-sized company has 
decided to modernize its server infrastructure. We provided technical 
support for the transition from an on-premise server to a cloud 
solution. Before the migration, it was explored which software 
subscription fits the size of the company.

The local directory structure including Active Directory has been 
backed up and synchronized to the cloud. The existing content and data 
were migrated to the cloud. This was done in parallel with the ongoing 
business without any decrease in productivity.

At the end of the migration, the cloud workstations were set up. 
Employees were instructed in the new workflows with SharePoint and 
OneDrive.

Thus, the migration from the existing local server structure to the 
cloud succeeded within a short time without disturbing the ongoing 
operation.
