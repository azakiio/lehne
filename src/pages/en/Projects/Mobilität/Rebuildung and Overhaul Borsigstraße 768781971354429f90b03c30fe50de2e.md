# Rebuildung and Overhaul Borsigstraße

Borsigstraße, in the Billbrook industrial and commercial estate, 
required a complete overhaul for reasons of serious road damage. Due to 
its location in an industrial estate with a high proportion of heavy 
goods traffic and the associated increased pollution of surface water, 
the existing road drainage system was demolished and replaced by a new 
pipework system. The polluted water was cleaned in an upstream rainwater
 treatment facility before entering the sewage system before being 
directed into the Billbrook canal.

The Borsigstraße is built over a large number of supply and disposal 
lines for the industrial area, and these formed a complex initial 
situation for the route planning. Intensive coordination with the 
pipework owners was necessary and expedient, since extensive rerouting 
work was necessary.

During the construction phase traffic management, consideration was 
given to the fact that adjacent operations including the Borsigstraße 
waste recycling facility and the Abfall-Verwertungs-Gesellschaft mbH 
required access during the construction measures.

The adjacent areas were also renewed during modernisation of the 
road. Cycle traffic was optimised comfortably and safely using a new 
cycle route. At the junction between 
Borsigstraße/Grusonstraße/Werner-Siemensstraße/Wöhlerstraße, a new 
system of traffic lights and additional signals for cyclists was 
required.
