# Rebuildung and overhaul Halenrei

The rebuilding and complete overhaul of the Halenreie comprised a 
road section of around 730 m. This road acts as a main traffic artery in
 the north-east Hamburg suburb of Volksdorf with local connection and 
development functions which had to be retained during the construction 
phase.

The road was characterised by extremely high, old avenue-type tree 
stocks. This was taken into consideration by the involvement of a tree 
expert during the planning phase, and considerable emphasis was placed 
on construction works for protecting the roots during the building 
implementation.

The existing tree stocks and the level of damage found in the 
existing road required quality improvement in the form of complete 
renovation. The condition of the adjacent surfaces also required 
improvement as well as the road surface. The footways and cycleways, 
especially, no longer met todayâ€™s planning requirements and were 
optimised during the contract.

A new road drainage system was planned, and this was connected to the
 existing ground filter system which sustainably cleaned the water 
before it was allowed to seep into the ground.
