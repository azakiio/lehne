# Rainwater treatment Moorfleeter Straße

The drainage system in the Moorfleeter Straße was checked to ensure 
that it conforms with the currently applicable water conservation laws 
during the course of modernisation. Investigations were made into 
whether drainage of the rainwater sewer with an outlet in the Billbrook 
canal require adaptation for reasons of water conservation requirements.
The high levels of traffic along the Moorfleeter Straße cause increased
pollution of the surface water which meant that water treatment 
facilities in acc. w. DWA – M153 were urgently required after 
investigation of the water pollution levels.

A range of different variations for rainwater treatment were 
developed for the 41 ha catchment area. This could not be provided 
underground due to the size of a regular sedimentation basin, which 
allows polluting water constituents to sediment through gravity. 
Construction of the basin above ground was also made impossible by the 
lack of hydraulic gradients. In the end a special structure made of 
sheet piling profiles and covering an area of 420 m² was developed in 
front of the outlet into the Billbrook canal. After consideration of 
costs for construction and the follow-on costs for maintenance of the 
facilities, several decentralised facilities adapted to the relevant 
road sections were planned instead of one central treatment works.
