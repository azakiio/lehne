# Bus acceleration lane Lange Reih

The Lange Reihe is right outside our office door in the suburb of St.
Georg, and is characterised by inner-city building development with 
residential, retail and gastronomic usage. The planning carried out was 
part of the city program for accelerating the Metro buses and was 
therefore aimed at strengthening public transport. The central location,
outdoor gastronomy and a committed district advisory council ensured 
considerable public interest and extensive discussions during the 
successful planning implementation.

The bus stops were repositioned at the edge of the road, and traffic 
light cycles were adapted so that journey times were reduced and comfort
 for the passengers was increased. Barrier-free crossing locations with 
tactile signing were set up for those with mobility restrictions and 
visual impairments.

For reasons of the tight road cross-section and the restricted width 
of adjacent surfaces, both the technical traffic planning and 
construction-phase traffic management were extremely detailed and 
required intensive coordination. Innovative solutions were required for 
traffic management during the construction phase, and these included 
changing the direction of a one-way street in order to protect the 
residents from increased traffic levels.
