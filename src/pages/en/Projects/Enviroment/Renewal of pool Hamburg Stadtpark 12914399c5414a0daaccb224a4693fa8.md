# Renewal of pool Hamburg Stadtpark

The Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg renewed the 3000 m² “paddling 
pool” in the play area in the Hamburger Stadtpark. The pool is made of 
reinforced concrete, and adaptation of the hydraulic system and the 
water pipework was necessary. Calculation of the hydraulic system was 
carried out based on the existing pool circulation volumes.

The pool circulating system was redesigned in order to distribute the
treated water throughout the pool. An optimum throughflow of the pool 
was achieved using variations in the location of the inflow openings and
the arrangement of horizontal and vertical inflow openings.

The horizontal inflow openings were formed as a special construction due to the shallow pool depth.
