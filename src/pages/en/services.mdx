# Services

We provide all engineering services necessary for demanding building
projects. We specialise particularly in provision of special solutions
due to local conditions, in short: building redevelopment.

We advise our customers
from the conception and feasibility analysis through pre-planning, the
design and approval of the construction work right up to planning
permission, detailed design, invitation to tender and award of tender in
addition to preparation of the building project. Depending on the
requirements we can take over additional services such as soils
investigations or tree surveys, accompanying landscape planning plans,
explosive ordinance disposal concepts or feasibility studies for which
specialists are brought into the team as required.

During the specific construction phase we carry out local site
supervision and site management including accounting and site
coordination. If required we can also offer technical coordination and
project management for complex civil engineering projects.

Our top priority is the provision of a timely, economic and high-quality service.

We have an excellent network of specialist engineers covering all
specialist disciplines such as geotechnics, formwork technology,
technical building services, surveying technology, city planning,
landscape planning and architecture.
