# Water

Water is of particular importance to Hamburg, and this is emphasised by its geographical location next to the river Elbe with its harbours, the interreactions of the tides on the coast, the surrounding low-level marshlands and extensive waterways in the city itself. This means that technical intervention and structures in areas containing groundwater, surface water and coastal regions is one of our special subjects. In this our core competences are flood protection extended in the form of tidal and inland dykes in addition to the renaturation of old dykes. Furthermore we plan the extension of waterways in a natural form or with waterfront walls in addition to new construction and upgrading of rainwater retention basins, retention areas, infiltration systems and throughflow structures. We are equally successful in the implementation of water law permit and planning permission processes.
