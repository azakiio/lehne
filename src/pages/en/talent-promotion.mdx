# Talent Promotion

At LEHNE ing. we have always cared about promoting
talent in a professional context or sports. With the Alster right
outside our offices the connection to water sports and sailing in
particular has been there ever since.

## Sailing - HEAT Sailing Team

For several years LEHNE ing. has been supporting
happily the HEAT Sailing team of Max Augustin and his crew. In this
period the team has achieved lots of good results in the Melges32 class
competitions around europe. We are happy to continue this partnership
and we wish them always at least one finger of water under the keel of the boat!
