# Working at LEHNE ing.

In addition to the high
quality planning contained in our drawings, our responsibilities include
combining the varying interests arising from politics, clients,
environment and energy, sustainability, public transport, police,
citizens, cyclists, people with disabilities and participating experts.
For this purpose we established a complex project management system with
the use of the most modern work flow principles including cloud office
and remote working. We bring the participants together and emphasize
transparent communication ensuring that solutions are driven forward.

At LEHNE ing. we actively
build a working environment to match our requirements. Our office is
located in Hamburg, St. Georg, close to the Alster and the main station
ensuring short trips to all our customers. We use public transport and –
in summer – our bikes to move around the city. Often on routes we
planned ourselves. Our office provides a newly-designed environment
which supports team work, communication, recreational areas and flat
hierarchies.
