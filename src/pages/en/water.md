# Water

Water is of particular importance to Hamburg, and this is emphasised
by its geographical location next to the river Elbe with its harbours,
the interreactions of the tides on the coast, the surrounding low-level
marshlands and extensive waterways in the city itself. This means that
technical intervention and structures in areas containing groundwater,
surface water and coastal regions is one of our special subjects. In
this our core competences are flood protection extended in the form of
tidal and inland dykes in addition to the renaturation of old dykes.
Furthermore we plan the extension of waterways in a natural form or with
waterfront walls in addition to new construction and upgrading of
rainwater retention basins, retention areas, infiltration systems and
throughflow structures. We are equally successful in the implementation
of water law permit and planning permission processes.
