# History

Since the foundation in 1956 by master builder Ulrich Riebau the company has developed to become a highly specialised and recognised consulting engineering company.
 LEHNE ing.'s expertise is well acknowledged in Hamburg.

The drive to take responsibility for the development of urban infrastructure and sustainable mobility in our city is deeply rooted in the Paul family's DNA.
What began in 1956 as an engineering office has grown into a modern, family-run consulting company that provides the full range of civil engineering services today.
The medium-sized company offers opportunities provided by both family-managed and future-oriented company culture.

The business development has been positive for more than 10 years and the growth has increased once again over the last few years, and we use this growth
 to incorporate fresh innovations and enable the full potential of our team.
