# Digitalisation

The digital transformation has been and will continue to be the
dominant topic almost all work sectors. Upgrading the telecommunication
infrastructure to the fiber standard, 5G mobile communication, cloud
office and remote work are just a few key aspects that will change the
work world permanently.

In particular the progress to cloud office and remote work has gained
much attention recently. Many different providers of software solutions
have emerged, which has made the decision a lot more complex. In this
context we have acquired substantial knowledge and experience as LEHNE
ing. started the digital transformation early. Our operative work is
migrated to the Microsoft 365 cloud completely.

Being very confident with our work flow in the cloud, we support
other businesses and public administration branches on their way to a
optimized work enviroment. We advice and support the installation and
migration of local server networks as well as cloud infrastructures,
satisfying all national and international data protection regulations
(DSGVO).
