## Pupil

We will gladly be of help during initial orientation in the working
world and are happy to receive curious, knowledge-hungry school
pupils. We attempt to integrate both “try-out days” and school
internships in our working day. The profession of engineer or
draughtsman can provide plenty of exciting aspects which are not always
apparent at first glance.
We would be happy to receive your application at [personal@lehne-ing.de](mailto:personal@lehne-ing.de).
