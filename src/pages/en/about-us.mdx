# About us

LEHNE Ingenieurgesellschaft has been active in the Hamburg
metropolitan region for over 60 years. More than 700
successfully-handled projects substantiate our extensive knowledge, and
we are very pleased to share this with our customers and develop it
further together. Daily work in a sector which is continually renewing
itself makes us a qualified and agile partner who can take on new and
unusual challenges and bring them to success.

As a team, we create top interdisciplinary performances through
inter-disciplinary exchange of issues. The permanent transfer of
knowledge between complex planning processes and specific structural
implementation guarantees targeted and results-oriented implementation.

Open dealings with our customers and all others participating in the
project, both internally and externally, are a matter of course for us.

We would be extremely pleased if we were able to count you amongst
our clients. Let our services convince you. After all, success can be
planned.
