# Infrastructure

Efficient infrastructure
forms the foundation of our society. It comprises the sectors of water,
energy and heat supply, data and communications technology in addition
to sustainable environmental and drainage technologies. Modernisation is
heavily influenced by increasing complexity and changes to the
networking of individual systems.

The requirements on modern,
future-oriented engineering services are increasing with the increasing
importance of a highly-technical infrastructure which has to be
operationally safe at the same time. We are able to support our
customers during implementation thanks to our many years of experience
in accompanying these projects and our up-to-date specialist knowledge.
