The leaking and aged fat separation facility and its connecting
pipework at the Campus Berliner Tor (HAW) required renewal. Fat
separators have the function of separating greases and oils from
wastewater. The wastewater and rinsing water from the student canteen
kitchen containing grease and oil is cleaned using such a facility
before it is allowed to enter the sewage system.

The old separation facility was replaced by a standard-conforming fat
separation facility so that the wastewater could be introduced into the
public mixed sewer. Furthermore, a reinforced concrete sample-taking
shaft was constructed underground. The damaged pipework made of
stoneware was replaced by modern PE pipework, and the building
connection was made using the core drilling process.

Provisional equipment for maintaining the drainage system was set up
during construction, and this was reconnected to suit the phases. After
this, paving work was carried out to make the surfaces accessible again.
