Business and industrial estates often result in the production of
wastewater containing pollutants which cannot be compared with normal
domestic waste water. This results in increased requirements on the
technical equipment, additional facilities during wastewater treatment
and regular monitoring and maintenance of the equipment. In such cases,
production-specific interests in addition to historically-enlarged old
buildings and areas have to be considered.

LEHNE ing. has been supporting various commercial and industrial
companies in the greater Hamburg area since the middle of the 90s, and
provides consultation, planning and site management for step-by-step
renovation of existing facilities. These opportunities are often used by
clients for the optimisation of existing processes and workflows. This
creates economic added value in addition to fulfilling environmental
engineering requirements.
