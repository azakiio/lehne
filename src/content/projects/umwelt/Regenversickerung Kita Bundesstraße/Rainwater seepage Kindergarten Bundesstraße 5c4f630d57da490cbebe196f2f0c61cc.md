A public kindergarten was converted and rebuilt during ongoing
operations in 2005 in the Hamburg suburb of Eimsbüttel. All surface
water which was produced had to be disposed of by seepage means for
reasons of the restricted local situation after the water was no longer
able to be introduced into a nearby waterway due to new buildings. An
underground seepage facility was constructed underneath a traffic area
for this purpose.

The necessary engineering services included the as-built survey,
clarification of water resources conditions in addition to the planning
and hydraulic dimensioning of the seepage facility including adaptation
of the property drainage facilities for the kindergarten.
