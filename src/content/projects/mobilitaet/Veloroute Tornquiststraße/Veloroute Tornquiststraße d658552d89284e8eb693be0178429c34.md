The urban infrastructure in Hamburg is being continuously extended
using so-called velo routes as a part of a high-speed cycleway network.
This is intended to make cycling safer and more attractive. Veloroute 2
connects the city – Eimsbüttel – Stellingen – Eidelstedt together over a
length of 11 km.

During upgrading and replanning of the route, several variations were
developed and discussed with public involvement. After extensive polls a
30 km/h zone and a cycleway were implemented. The road construction
work included, amongst other things, renovation of the historic road
surface (small cobblestones and asphalt) and the widening of a
partially-existing two-lane cycleway to a width of 4 m. The complete
planning area was constructed to be barrier-free and fitted out with
tactile signing.

It was also possible to build a roundabout with barrier-free construction of pedestrian crossings to optimise traffic flow.
