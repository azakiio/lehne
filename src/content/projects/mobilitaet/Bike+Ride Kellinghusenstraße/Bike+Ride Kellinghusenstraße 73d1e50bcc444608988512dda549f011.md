It is important to link different means of transport together to
ensure sustainable and future-capable mobility in Hamburg. Bike+Ride
locations (B+R) at which bicycles can be parked before the journey is
continued on public transport act as a link between cycle traffic and
the city’s public transport.

The area adjacent to the Kellinghusenstraße subway station was
re-planned during the course of the B+R development concept decided by
the Hamburg Senate. The aim of the concept is to provide attractive
linkage points to public transport following a uniform standard.

In this project over 200 bicycle holders for 400 bicycles and a
bicycle parking garage with two levels for 600 bicycles were planned
within a radius of 60 m to the station so that passengers would have a
direct connection with the subway station after parking their bicycles.
In addition an area was planned for a CityBike station, which makes
returning rented bicycles easier. Car, cycle or pedestrian traffic was
not affected by the construction measures.
