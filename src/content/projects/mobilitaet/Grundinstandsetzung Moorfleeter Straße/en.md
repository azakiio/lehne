The measure was based on existing old plans, which had to be updated with regard to current technical requirements.

Due to considerable damage and greatly changed requirements for the
road, the Moorfleeter Straße from nördl. Berzeliusstraße to südl.
Liebigstraße was fully developed in accordance with ER 1, BK SV (30-H)
and fundamentally repaired. The lane layout was retained. The road
surface as well as the footpaths and cycle paths have been completely
renewed. The double-track level crossing was abolished.

For drainage,30 cm wide watercourses were made of cast asphalt and road drains with
connection to the existing rainwater drainage were installed. The
measure thus covered an area of around 11,000 m².

Since the road is located in the industrial area and is a direct
connection to the Jenfeld motorway junction, it was particularly
important to direct traffic as smoothly as possible.
