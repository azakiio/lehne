The Horster Damm road, in the East of Hamburg, required technical
protection to its embankment down to the adjacent waterway because the
carriageway had been damaged by settlement and the stability of the
carriageway could no longer be guaranteed.

For reasons of the restricted local situation at the waterway a
supporting wall of around 250 m in length was constructed as slope
protection in the affected area. The existing bridges needed
reconstruction to provide connections for the residents. The location of
the construction site in water conservation area also required
consideration.

Intensive negotiations were carried out with the affected residents
before implementation so that the necessary permits and consents could
be acquired as soon as possible. Engineering services included planning
work, drawing up and acquiring the permits and consents, static
calculations in addition to drawing up the implementation and bid documents.
