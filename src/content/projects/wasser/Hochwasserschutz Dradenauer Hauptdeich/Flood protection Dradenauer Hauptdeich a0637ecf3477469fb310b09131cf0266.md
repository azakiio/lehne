The flood protection system in the south of Hamburg was toughened up
along a length of around 4 km during reconstruction of the so-called
“Finkenwerder junction”. During these works earth dykes, floodwater
protection walls with extensive pipework breakthrough works, road and
rail crossings were constructed.

After completion, the facilities were surveyed and refurbished in
accordance with technical services requirements, and technical as-built
documentation was provided for operation of the facilities.

Engineering services included professional drawing up of as-built
plans and as-built documentation, especially digital refurbishment of
the extensive data material.
