A new residential and business district is being built in the
emerging Hamburg suburb of Harburg south of the Elbe. A former rail
freight depot at the Harburg inland port was to be given new use. A new
building area was developed over an area of 10 ha for this purpose. The
area was connected and developed using a new road to provide the
infrastructure. Furthermore, public sewage equipment, power, drinking
water, heat supply and public road lighting were planned and
constructed.

Before work could be started on the extensive supply lines the
abandoned area had to be cleared of explosive ordinances. After this,
rainwater sewers and road and property drainage was constructed. One
item worthy of note is a rainwater outlet which was drilled through an
existing quay wall and built in at a diameter of 1 m.

After this, connections were made to a modern cogeneration unit
specially constructed for the new area in order to provide the residents
with district heating. The road areas were designed and developed
together with the developer on the basis of the development concept.
