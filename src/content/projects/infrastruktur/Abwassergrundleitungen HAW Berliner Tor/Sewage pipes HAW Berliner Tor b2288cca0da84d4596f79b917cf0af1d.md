During the course of building works, all underground drainage systems
such as collector and connection lines in addition to manhole shafts
were to be renovated at the Campus Berliner Tor (HAW). The overall
length of the drainage network requiring renovation on the campus, which
has an area of around 3 ha, was approx. 3.5 km and has been designed as a mixed water system.

The CCTV inspection carried out showed sediment deposits up to pipe
breakage, and the damage was assessed using priority classes and action
recommendations were then issued.

The renovation concept adapted to these recommendations intended that
heavily-damaged lines and manholes were to be rebuilt during open
construction and replaced with new pipework. Pipework with lower levels
of damage was renovated during enclosed construction using inliners,
especially where the pipes were difficult to access or ran underneath
buildings.
