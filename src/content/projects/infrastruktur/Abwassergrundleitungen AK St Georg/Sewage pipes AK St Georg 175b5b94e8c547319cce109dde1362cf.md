The side of the Asklepios St. Georg hospital was completely
renovated. For this purpose the drainage system, which consisted of
partial and mixed piping in which all drainage water (wastewater and
rainwater) was drained off in common pipework, was reconstructed. The
mixed water pipework is linked together with 40 buildings, 2.7 km of
main pipework, 3.5 km of connecting pipework and around 200 shafts on
the premises, which has an area of 8.5 ha.

This meant that all drainage collection lines and manhole shafts
required modernisation during the construction measures. For this
purpose, some of the old lines and shafts were abandoned and
appropriately backfilled. The newly-constructed pipework and shafts
consist of high-resistance polypropylene and was connected using
electro-welding joints. The technology used meant that an absolutely
seal tight and extremely resistant long-term system, which can accept
all drainage from the roof surfaces, the surrounding sealed areas and
the commercial and domestic drainage water arising from hospital
operations, was installed.

The restricted space and vicinity to the buildings required a type of
open trench construction which inhibited vibration in order not to
affect hospital operations.
