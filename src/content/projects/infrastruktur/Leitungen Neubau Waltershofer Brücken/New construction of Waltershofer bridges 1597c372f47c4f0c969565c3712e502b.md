The Hamburg Port Authority (HPA) intended to improve the logistics at
the largest container terminal in Hamburg harbour and to make it viable
through reconstruction of the Waltershofer bridges during the course of
traffic linkage with the Burchardkais.Â  This required the
reconstruction of an additional track, the actual rail bridges
themselves, the associated road bridges and the construction of new
roads in the connecting areas.

In this context numerous service lines with superordinate supply
functions from providers and disposers were rerouted. The old bridges
were lifted off their abutments with the aid of the tide. For this
purpose the supply lines were initially routed over a provisional bridge
in order to guarantee supply reliability. After this the lines were
placed along a new route safe from flooding.

The new bridges were given widened carriageway cross-sections. During
construction the bridge abutments had to be re-dimensioned and traffic
areas had to be adapted. Provisional traffic flow was provided over the
new rail bridge during the period of road and bridge construction
measures.
