In the course of extensions to a retirement home complex in Hamburg,
planning services for the outdoor facilities and drainage of a new
building in addition to the existing rainwater and wastewater drainage
were required.

The property of 2.5 ha, which is located on Schillingsbek, was fitted
out with barrier-free outdoor facilities. The footpaths were
constructed with low longitudinal gradients and crossfalls. Special
concrete paving without bevels was selected for the surfacing in order
to increase accessibility to residents with walking aids.

A rainwater retention system of 55 m in length was constructed for
the draining the new building. The existing drainage to the existing
buildings was extended using a reservoir infiltration ditch which had a
retention function and relieved the outflow volume into the
Schillingsbek. The basis of this was formed by the calculated rainwater
outflow and dimensioning of the required retention volume. Planning
services also included obtaining all the required building and water
rights permits.
