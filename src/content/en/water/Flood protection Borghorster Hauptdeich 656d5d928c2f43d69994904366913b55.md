# Flood protection Borghorster Hauptdeich

The flood protection program for the Free and Hanseatic City of 
Hamburg intends that the earth dyke in the floodwater protection line 
along the Elbe is to be adapted to new technical requirements and 
protection heights to provide safety against storm surges.

The 2 km long Borghorster Hauptdeich is an earth dyke along the north
 bank of the Elbe which is characterised by partially historic buildings
on the land side along the existing old dyke, the adjacent water 
conservation area and also the adjacent nature reserve on the water side
of the dike which is registered as an EU flora-fauna habitat area.

Due to the traffic requirements a roundabout was constructed at the 
junction with the dyke protection road in order to improve the traffic 
flow.

Engineering services included all planning phases, especially drawing
up of the planning commission documents to follow water law, 
accompanying of the continuing approval process, drawing up the 
implementation and bid documents in addition to technical engineering 
supervision during the construction phase.
