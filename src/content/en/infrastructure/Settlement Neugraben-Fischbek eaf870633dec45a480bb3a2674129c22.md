# Settlement Neugraben-Fischbek

The new Vogelkamp residential area in Neugraben Fischbek provides 
space for around 1500 residential units consisting of detached, 
semi-detached and terraced housing over a total area of 70 ha. The 
planning area was divided into a total of four construction phases, 
which were planned and developed in parallel. The new development area 
is located between the “Moorgürtel” nature reserve and the 
Hamburg-Neugraben subway station in a water conservation area.

A total of approx. 11 km of rainwater and wastewater pipework of 
diameters DN 250 up to DN 1400 was required. The engineering services 
included all planning work such as drawing up the settlement plans, the 
necessary draft and implementation plans in addition to drawing up of 
the bid documents.

The sewage pipework was built in open construction using four gangs 
in parallel in order to guarantee the quickest-possible completion.
