# Remote office administration

Due to the pandemic situation of recent years, working on the road and at home has become significantly more relevant. For the setup of remote or home office workstations and the necessary technical infrastructure, we are happy to provide our know-how.

We provide full support in terms of planning, installation and administration. We are also happy to take over the technical training of employees in video telephony, the structuring of team conferences and the handling of file sharing systems.

The basis of modern mobile working is the digitization of work content and processes. We are happy to support.
